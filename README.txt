NFT Minting Simulation
This project simulates the minting of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) with a focus on music-related metadata. The JavaScript code creates NFT objects representing music tracks and stores their metadata, such as title, artist, genre, and album. The project includes functions to mint new NFTs, list all minted NFTs, and get the total supply of NFTs.

Features
Mint NFTs: Create NFT objects with metadata related to music tracks.
List NFTs: Print the metadata of all minted NFTs to the console.
Total Supply: Return the total number of NFTs created.
